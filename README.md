# Bike-Demand
So my next assignment got me to touch base with Regression Analysis. To put it simply, Regression Analysis looks at the relationship between the dependent variable vs the other independent variable(s). So one quick example will be, does Ice Cream sales increase during the Summer? So the weather is the independent variable and Ice Cream sales is the dependent variable. So of cos, this can then be used as a predictive tool to make decisions (e.g. Ice Cream company stocks up more Ice Cream during summer due to demand).

Bike Sharing Demand
So for this assignment, I am not doing Ice Cream sales vs Weather but rather Bicycle sharing demand vs variables like time of the day and weather. The details of this challenge can be seen, here. So as always, it's good to first size up the data we are working with.
